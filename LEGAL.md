## General Principles

1. **No reason required**: In all covered jurisdictions, the requester does not need to state a reason for the request (with limited exceptions in India for security-related bodies).

2. **Burden on the authority**: The burden of justifying non-disclosure rests with the public authority, not the requester.

3. **Segregability**: All jurisdictions require that non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt documents be released.

4. **Public interest**: Most exemptions (especially qualified/non-absolute ones) are subject to a public interest balancing test.

5. **No cost for filing**: Filing the request itself is free in the US (federal and state), UK, and EU. India charges a nominal Rs. 10 fee (with BPL exemption).

6. **Electronic preferred**: All jurisdictions accept or require electronic filing and encourage electronic delivery of responsive records.

7. **Appeals are free**: Administrative appeals are free to file in all jurisdictions. Judicial review may involve court costs.
